# ROBOT / VAL
The Robot package includes everything that has to do with VAL. This package has the main Robot class, which works as essentially the delegate between the brains of VAL and it's parts. We will be separating everything into two different categories "Simulated" and "Real". We want to have the option to drop VAL into a simulator to see how she will react to different situations. But in the end we are creating an AI for a robot, so we will have to engineer classes and code for the real-life sensors and servos.

It is very important we don't give VAL any information she can't have. All of her information comes through her sensors and she has to act upon that information. When we start developing the AI portion, we have to make sure, she will only act based on the information given from the sensors and not the information from objects outside this package. If we were to act upon other information, the real-world robot would be very confused, as it would not be able to get this information at all.
