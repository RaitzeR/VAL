# VAL
VAL (Visual Area Layer) is a Robot which roams around your house and maps the space. At this moment VAL is just a simulation, in which you can drive around a map and scan walls. Later on VAL will get AI components and ultimately she will be built into a Raspberry Pi powered robot. Stay tuned!

This project is part of a Youtube video series I'm doing, called 1 Month 1 Project, in which I dedicate one month for one project. The first month I decided to create a robot on top of the Raspberry Pi my brother gave me as a birthday present. I hope you get some use out of this codebase. I will update this README with some simple how-tos to help you create your own VAL!
